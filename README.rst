shabc
=====

shabc (shabc.sh) is a shell script useful for me when I want to use UNIX command line tools as abc2midi, abc2mps and abc2abc.

The original development (at least 15 years ago) was made under Linux, but since I'm using an Apple computer at home, I modified it for this platform.

Some features are :

- the interface is fully oriented keyboard with shortcuts

- it is possible to manage series independently of the locations of the tunes on the filesystem

- when you quit the application, the last tune is save so you retreve it next time you open it

- under MacOSX, the view and the playing are processed with safari. In the Linux version, timidity and a ghoscript viewer were used for those purposes. Traces of Linux version remains in the code.

NB: as I'm french, the interface is all in french... sorry...

I often use my application when I learn or re-learn Irish tunes.

The script FaireHTML.sh is used under a Linux/apache2 server to generate web interface of my set of tunes.
