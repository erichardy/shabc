shabc
=====

shabc (shabc.sh) is a shell script useful for me when I want to use UNIX command line tools as abc2midi, abc2mps and anc2abc.

The original development was made under Linux, but since I use an Apple computer at home, I modified it for this platform.

Some features are :

- the interface is fully oriented keyboard with shortcuts

- when I leave the application, the last tune is save so I retreave it netxt time I play with it

- it is possible to manage series independently of the locations of the tunes on the filesystem

- under MacOSX, the view and the playing are processed with safari. In the Linux version, timidity and a ghoscript viewer were used for those purposes. Traces of Linux version remains in the code.

NB: as I'm french, the interface is all in french... sorry...
